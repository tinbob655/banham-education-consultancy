                                    We offer several different programmes which can get you up to speed or ahead of the game in History. Firstly, there is our Elite 1-to-1 tutoring. This involves a meeting with Dale Banham in which you can be caught-up on any content you might have missed or not fully grasped. Then, there's our headstarter programme. This is for students in years 10/12 who want to get ahead before they start their new history course. Finally, our support for schools programme will involve a lecture to a large group of students about any historical topics, again conducted by Dale Banham.
